# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :
As a task of CODTECH internship, I built a Real-time collaborative code editor.I aim to create a real-time collaborative document editor using React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface, MongoDB for efficient data storage, and Node.js as the backend framework. The system should allow multiple users to join the same editing session, working collaboratively on a shared document. Using WebSocket communication, I will implement real-time updates so any changes made by one user are immediately reflected for all other participants in the same room. User authentication and session management will ensure that users are authenticated and changes are securely tracked. Routes will be handled in the backend using Node.js and Express.js, with API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and managing collaborative sessions. A central MongoDB database will store document data and user activity logs, ensuring that edits are preserved even if users leave and rejoin the session. I will design the front end in React.js, leveraging state management libraries like Redux or Context API for efficiently handling the application state, such as tracking users in a room or managing document content updates in real time. The backend will be designed using Node.js, with an event-driven architecture to handle simultaneous requests and WebSocket connections. To ensure simultaneous changes are synchronized across users, I will implement operational transformation (OT) or conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), which resolve editing conflicts in real time. MongoDB's flexible schema will allow storing document versions, user metadata, and session details. User authentication will be managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or similar mechanisms, ensuring a secure and seamless login experience. The editor will also feature room-based collaboration, where users can create or join rooms identified by unique IDs, and only users within the same room can view and edit the document. I will use environment variables for sensitive configurations like database URLs and authentication keys. Additionally, the interface will include essential text formatting tools and options for document saving and exporting. Error handling and logging mechanisms will be implemented for troubleshooting and monitoring the application. The ultimate goal is to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly collaborative editing platform that combines real-time functionality, smooth UI interactions, and secure backend services.
This real-time collaborative document editor stands out due to its powerful combination of technologies and feature-rich design. The seamless synchronization of edits across multiple users ensures an unparalleled collaborative experience. Real-time updates powered by WebSockets allow every user in the same room to see changes instantly, fostering effective teamwork. The use of React.js provides a highly dynamic and interactive user interface, making the editing process smooth and intuitive. With MongoDB as the database, the application benefits from scalable and flexible data management, ensuring that documents and user activities are reliably stored and accessible. The backend, built with Node.js, guarantees a robust and efficient framework capable of handling concurrent requests and maintaining consistent communication between users. The implementation of room-based collaboration ensures that editing sessions remain private and focused, while operational transformation or CRDTs effectively handle simultaneous edits, preventing conflicts and data loss.
In conclusion, this project showcases a thoughtful integration of cutting-edge technologies to deliver a modern and efficient collaborative editing solution. React.js powers the responsive front end, MongoDB ensures reliable and scalable data storage, and Node.js with WebSocket communication enables real-time interactions and seamless backend operations. Together, these technologies form the backbone of a feature-rich and user-focused collaborative editing platform. I have named my project as **TelePresence**.
